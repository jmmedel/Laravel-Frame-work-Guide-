Laravel Release Process
The following points are worth notable in the context of understanding the release process of Laravel −

The old directory of app/models is removed in Laravel 5.1.

All the controllers, middleware and requests are grouped within a directory under the app/Http folder.

A new folder namely Providers directory is replaced with the app/start files in the previous versions of Laravel 4.x.

All the language files and views are moved to the resources directory.

New artisan command route:cache is used for registration of new routes and is included with the release of Laravel 5.1 and further versions.

Laravel supports HTTP middleware and also includes CSRF tokens and authentication model.

All the authentication models are located under one directory namely resources/views/auth. It includes user registration, authentication and password controllers.
