 Previous Page Next Page  
Laravel has made processing with database very easy. Laravel currently supports following 4 databases âˆ’

MySQL
Postgres
SQLite
SQL Server
The query to the database can be fired using raw SQL, the fluent query builder, and the Eloquent ORM. To understand the all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with Laravel, we will use simple student management system.

Connecting to Database
Configure the database in config/database.php file and create the college database with structure in MySQL as shown in the following table.

Database: College

Table: student

Column Name	Column Datatype	Extra
Id	int(11)	Primary key | Auto increment
Name	varchar(25)	
We will see how to add, delete, update and retrieve records from database using Laravel in student table.

Sr.No.	Records & Description
